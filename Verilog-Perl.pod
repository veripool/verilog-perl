=head1 NAME

Verilog-Perl - Overview of Verilog language packages for Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Verilog-Perl distribution provides Perl parsing and utilities for the
Verilog Language.  This file provides an overview of the distribution, for
specific details on each component, see that component's manpage.

You may also want to try the AUTO features present in
L<http://www.veripool.com/verilog-mode.html> Verilog-Mode.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Skip this section if Verilog-Perl has already been installed.

=head2 Supported Systems

Verilog-Perl should run on any system with Perl, G++, Flex, and Bison.  It
is known to work on at least:

=over 4

=item * sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1

=item * i386-linux

=item * i686-w2k-cygwin

=back

=head2 CPAN Installation

=over 4

Easiest installation is using the "CPAN" command line that comes with Perl.
After configuring CPAN the first time, simply

   $ cpan
   cpan> install Verilog-Perl

Read the rest of this file for details on the programs provided.

=head2 Manual Installation

=over 4

Download the latest version from L<http://www.perl.org/CPAN/>, or
from L<http://www.veripool.com/verilog-perl.html>.

C<cd> to the directory containing this README notice.

Type C<perl Makefile.PL> to configure Verilog for your system.

Type C<make> to compile Verilog.  Some Solaris users have had
trouble with "open" being redefined.  If this happens, try editing
the Makefile to change _FILE_OFFSET_BITS to 32 instead of 64.

Type C<make test> to check the package.  If you don't have
Synopsys' VCS, the test will print a warning, which you can ignore.

Type C<make install> to install the programs and any data files and
documentation.

=head1 SCRIPTS

The following scripts are installed by Verilog-Perl:

=over 4

=item L<vhier>

Vhier reads the Verilog files passed on the command line and outputs a tree
of all of the filenames, modules, and cells referenced by that file.

=item L<vpm>

Vpm will read the specified Verilog files and preprocess special PLI
assertions.

=item L<vppp>

Vppp reads the Verilog files passed on the command line and outputs
preprocessed output.

=item L<vrename>

Vrename will allow a signal to be changed across all levels of the design
hierarchy, or to create a cross reference of signal names.

=back

=head1 PACKAGES

=over 4

=item L<Verilog::Getopt|Verilog::Getopt>

Verilog::Getopt provides standardized handling of options similar to
Verilog/VCS and cc/GCC.

=item L<Verilog::Language|Verilog::Language>

Verilog::Language provides general utilities for using the Verilog
Language, such as parsing numbers or determing what keywords exist.

=item L<Verilog::Netlist|Verilog::Netlist>

Verilog::Netlist reads and holds interconnect information about a whole
design database.

=item L<Verilog::Netlist::Cell|Verilog::Netlist::Cell>

A Verilog::Netlist::Cell object is created by Verilog::Netlist for every
instantiation in the current module.

=item L<Verilog::Netlist::File|Verilog::Netlist::File>

Verilog::Netlist::File allows Verilog::Netlist objects to be read and
written in Verilog format.

=item L<Verilog::Netlist::Module|Verilog::Netlist::Module>

A Verilog::Netlist::Module object is created by Verilog::Netlist for every
module in the design.

=item L<Verilog::Netlist::Net|Verilog::Netlist::Net>

A Verilog::Netlist::Net object is created by Verilog::Netlist::Module for
every signal and input/output declaration in the current module.

=item L<Verilog::Netlist::Pin|Verilog::Netlist::Pin>

A Verilog::Netlist::Pin object is created by Verilog::Netlist::Cell for for
each pin connection on a cell.

=item L<Verilog::Netlist::Port|Verilog::Netlist::Port>

A Verilog::Netlist::Port object is created by Verilog::Netlist::Module for
every port connection in the module.

=item L<Verilog::Netlist::Subclas|Verilog::Netlist::Subclass>

The Verilog::Netlist::Subclass is used as a base class for all
Verilog::Netlist::* structures.

=item L<Verilog::Parser|Verilog::Parser>

Verilog::Parser will tokenize a Verilog file and invoke various callback
methods.

=item L<Verilog::Preproc|Verilog::Preproc>

Verilog::Preproc reads Verilog files, and preprocesses them according to
the Verilog specification.  Programs can be easily converted from reading a
IO::File into reading preprocessed output from Verilog::Preproc.

=item L<Verilog::SigParse|Verilog::SigParser>

Verilog::SigParser builds upon the Verilog::Parser package to provide
callbacks for when a signal is declared, a module instantiated, or a module
defined.

=head1 WHICH PARSER PACKAGE?

If you are starting a new application which needs to parse the Verilog
language you have several tools available to you.  Which you pick depends
on how low level and complete the information you need is.

=over 4

=item Verilog::Preproc

Verilog::Preproc is useful when you need only text out, or a list of
defines, etc.  It can preprocess a file, or be used to provide the Verilog
macro language on top of synthesis scripts.  It understands the full
SystemVerilog 2005 preprocessor syntax.

=item Verilog::Parser

Verilog::Parser is useful when you need to tokenize or write source filters
(where you need everything including whitespace).  It can take raw files,
or preprocessed input.  It understands all SystemVerilog 2005 keywords.

=item Verilog::SigParser

Verilog::SigParser is useful when you need a list of modules, signals,
ports, functions, etc.  It requires a preprocessed file, and can parse most
Verilog 2005 files, but only provides callbacks on certain interesting
things.

=item Verilog::Netlist

Verilog::Netlist is useful for when you need the hierarchy, and a list of
signals per module, pins per cell, etc.  It builds upon the output of
Verilog::SigParser, so requires preprocessed files.

This is probably the most popular choice.

=item VPI

Using the VPI is the best way to access the behavior of the design.  It is
not part of this package as it requires a compliant simulator and C++ code
to call the VPI, and understands as much of the language as the simulator
supports.  This allows writing lint checks and full knowledge of all parts
of the code, but generally requires the most work (short of writing a
parser from scratch.)
