Description
===========

   This package provides functions to support writing utilities that use
the Verilog language.  See `man Verilog::Language' and `man vrename'
after installation.

   Included is `vrename', a program for renaming signals, modules, and
parameters across many verilog files at once.

   `vppp' is a Verilog preprocessor.  Low level classes allow
preprocessing inside of Perl or C++ programs as a standard stream.

   Also included is `vpm' to convert macros that look like pli calls,
such as $info, into different Verilog code.  This enables programs like
Verilint and Synopsys dc_shell to ignore the macros (as they ignore pli
calls), but have the simulator do something special with them.

   For example:

           $info (0, "Welcome to a VPMed file\n");

   becomes

           ... $write ("[%0t] -I:example.v:0012: Welcome to a VPMed file\n",$time); ...

   where the filename and line number of the message have been added
along with the timestamp.

Complete Parsing
================

   The lower level parsing routines do not keep behavioral statements,
or bit connectivity within busses.  If you're looking for a front end
that keeps all information, you may want to consider using the C++
front end that is part of Verilator.  See
`http://www.veripool.com/verilator.html'.

Obtaining Distribution
======================

   The latest version is available at `http://www.perl.org/CPAN/'

   Download the latest package from that site, and decompress.  `gunzip
Verilog-Perl_version.tar.gz ; tar xvf Verilog-Perl_version.tar'

Supported Systems
=================

   This version of Verilog has been built and tested on:

   * sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1

   * i386-linux

   * i686-w2k-cygwin

   It should run on any system with Perl, G++ and Flex.

Installation
============

  1. `cd' to the directory containing this README notice.

  2. Type `perl Makefile.PL' to configure Verilog for your system.

  3. Type `make' to compile Verilog.  Some Solaris users have had
     trouble with "open" being redefined.  If this happens, try editing
     the Makefile to change _FILE_OFFSET_BITS to 32 instead of 64.

  4. Type `make test' to check the package.  If you don't have
     Synopsys' VCS, the test will print a warning, which you can ignore.

  5. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  6. Look at `t/60_vpm.t' to see how to use `vpm' in your build
     methodology.
